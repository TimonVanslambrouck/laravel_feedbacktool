# Laravel feedbacktool

This laravel app is an app meant for psychologists to see the impact of their sessions on their patients.
The therapist can add new patients and save the sessions they have with their patients.
After a session they have the possibility to ask feedback from the patients. 
When doing this the site will generate a custom URL which can be opened immediatly after the session or on a later date.
The inputs from the patients will be saved in a graph to have an easy way to watch the progress over time.
